This project analyzes medical insurance charges using statistical and machine learning techniques to identify key cost drivers and predict premiums accurately. The dataset includes variables such as age, BMI, number of children, sex, smoking status, and region. Visualizations revealed that charges are right-skewed, especially high for smokers and individuals in the Southeast region. Regression plots showed strong positive correlations between charges and age or BMI, particularly among smokers.

Several models were used, including linear regression, ridge, lasso, random forest, and polynomial regression. While linear models performed moderately well, the random forest and polynomial regression models showed superior predictive power. Polynomial regression (degree 2) achieved the highest RÂ² score (\~0.89), effectively capturing non-linear relationships. Feature importance analysis consistently highlighted smoking status, age, and BMI as the most influential predictors.

The study recommends policy actions such as incentivizing smoking cessation through premium discounts or wellness programs, promoting BMI control through fitness initiatives, and region-specific premium adjustments to reflect localized risks. These data-driven insights support fairer, preventive healthcare strategies. Overall, the use of advanced regression methods enhances predictive accuracy and provides a foundation for equitable and efficient insurance pricing.
